## Introduction
This is a toy implementation of a Tensor class, inspired by popular machine learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to create a basic tensor class with essential operations and functionality, to help you understand the core concepts behind tensor-based machine learning.

## Key Features
- Basic tensor operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Matrix multiplication
- Handling of tensor shapes and sizes
- Gradient tracking and backpropagation
- Serialization and persistence
- Unit testing and comprehensive documentation
